<b>Our Project: Debugging the Nation</b>

What is Debugging the Nation?

Our project is a model of a booking system for NHS appointments. With the system, an NHS administrator can book, cancel, or reschedule doctors appointments for 
patients. The appointments are stored in a SQL database and different queries can be run that allow the administrator to see details of appointments and patient records.
They can also add new patients to the system.

The technologies used for this project were Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL database. <i>Additional technologies used were... </i>

Whhy make this system?

We chose this project because we had several group members work for the NHS so we were very familiar with the operations such a system needs to be able to perform. 
There are also lots of options for filtering and returning results for this sort of system, which allows us to extend it easily.
